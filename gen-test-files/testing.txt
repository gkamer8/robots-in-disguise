Name: Jared Simpson
Age: 22
Description: Harvard College student

Jared Simpson had blue eyes and blond hair, with brown eyes. He was born in the Bronx, New York, but grew up in Queens, where he attended high school. His parents divorced when he was a young child, and he moved to California at age 13. After graduating from high school, he went to work as a security guard for an insurance company. In his spare time, he enjoyed playing video games and watching movies.

In 2007, he began working as a driver’s license clerk at a local DMV office. At first, he didn’t know how to drive, so he started driving himself. Eventually, he learned how to drive on his own, and by 2010, he was able to get a drivers license.

He graduated from college in 2011 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. Since then, he has been working full-time as a driver's license clerk at various DMV offices around the country.

When asked about his dream job, he said, “I would love to be a police officer. I have always wanted to do something like that.”

Simpson is currently enrolled in graduate school at Columbia University, where he hopes to become a criminal justice professor.
